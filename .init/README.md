## Don't Edit Here
These files contain example configs and extras that are deployed when running `make project-init` or `make-init`.
The directory structure starting under project/ is overlayed on top of the project root.

The files deployed from this section should be added to git ignore in their root locations, since we encourage users
to edit them, and don't want to have merge conflicts when we / they update.
