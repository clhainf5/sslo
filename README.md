## Configuration

### Configure Grafana
The Grafana instance can be configured via environment variables using their standard
[options](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/#override-configuration-with-environment-variables).

The included .env (present after running `make init`) can be modified to set the initial admin
password to a value you select:

```
# Grafana Environment Variables
# These should be updated to more secure values.
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=admin
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
```

#### View The Dashboards
The default Grafana user/pass is `admin/admin`, and can be accessed at
`http://<hostname>:3000`.


## Updating Project Versions
Updating to a new release of this repo can be done with the following general process.

1. Review the release notes for all intermediate versions and check for warnings about
special instructions / breaking changes.
2. Recommended: backup this directory and all files.
3. Stash changes, update the repo state, and unstash changes as follows:

```shell
make stop
# This assumes you're upgrading from one v1.0.0+ version to another.
git stash
make upgrade-ast RELEASE_VERSION=v1.0.1 # (Desired release version, e.g. v1.0.1)
git stash pop
# <check for warning messages and merge any conflicts with your local changes>
make start
```
