### Installation

Clone the repo or download source tarball from the [release](https://github.com/f5devcentral/application-study-tool/releases) section.

```shell
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/clhainf5/sslo 
cd sslo
# If AppFramework is still private:
# Generate a PAT with Read permission in f5observabilityhub/AppFramework on "Contents" 
git config submodule.AppFramework.url https://USERNAME:PAT@github.com:/F5ObservabilityHub/AppFramework # Only required if AppFramework is still private:
# This must be run before anything else to fully initialize the project layout
# The files listed below will not exist at the specified paths until this is run.
make init
# Create testing certs to use on the syslog receiver listener
make test-certs
# Depending on your docker environment you may need to allow the user in the otel collector (10001) access to it
sudo chown 10001 services/otel_collector/ssl/key.pem
# Start the tool
make start
# Load generator
python ./load_test.py
```

<details>
<summary>Instructions Without Make</summary>

```shell
# Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/clhainf5/sslo 
cd sslo
# Initialize the core AppFramework components
git submodule init
git submodule update
# Copy the any template config files
find ./.init/project -type f | while read src; do \
    dest=$${src/.init\/project\//}; \
    dest_dir=$$(dirname $$dest); \
    mkdir -p $$dest_dir; \
    echo "üìÑ Copying $$src to $$dest..."; \
    if [ ! -f $$dest ]; then \
      cp -rn $$src $$dest; \
      echo "  ‚úÖ $$dest file created."; \
    else \
      echo "  ‚ö†Ô∏è  $$dest already exists. Skipping copy."; \
    fi \
  done
# Optional, run the openssl commands in Makefile to generate certificates for collector to use, or provide your own in services/otel_collector/ssl
# Edit env files and config files as required by the project #TODO - list these out
vi .env
# Start the tool
docker compose up -d
```

## Configuration

### Configure Grafana
The Grafana instance can be configured via environment variables using their standard
[options](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/#override-configuration-with-environment-variables).

The included .env (present after running `make init`) can be modified to set the initial admin
password to a value you select:

```
# Grafana Environment Variables
# These should be updated to more secure values.
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=admin
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin
```

#### View The Dashboards
The default Grafana user/pass is `admin/admin`, and can be accessed at
`http://<hostname>:3000`.
